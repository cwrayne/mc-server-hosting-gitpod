# mc-server-hosting-gitpod
Java and Bedrock server hosting FOR FREE thats actually really good with gitpod
**(Currently WIP)**

# THIS IS STILL BEING WORKED ON, MOST THINGS WILL NOT WORK

# Instructions
## Make a Gitpod Workspace
Go [here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/cwrayne/mc-server-hosting-gitpod) and login/create an account if you haven't already. Then, switch Standard to Large for a better machine (This is completely optional, but recommended) and then press Continue.
**YOU WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THE BROWSER WINDOW OPEN TO KEEP THE SERVER RUNNING!**
## Make the server
Run `chmod +x setup.sh` and then run `./setup.sh`.
Then either run `./download_java.sh` or `./download_bedrock.sh` to download either Java or Bedrock (You will select the server type when running the file)
